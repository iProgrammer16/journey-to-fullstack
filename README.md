# Journey to Full-Stack Developer

This repository documents my learning journey towards becoming a full-stack developer. It contains various projects and resources that I've worked on, organized into:

- **front-end**: Projects and exercises focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks.
- **back-end**: Projects related to server-side programming, databases, APIs, and backend frameworks.

Along the way, I've explored different technologies and concepts, building practical skills to become a well-rounded developer.

Feel free to explore and learn with me!

ðŸš€ Happy coding!
